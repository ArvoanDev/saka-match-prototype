## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional car search filters (Make, Model, Year, Power) assume the user is a car expert. However, most buyers start with a **life need**, not a technical specification.

- **Current State:** "I need a 2020 Volvo V60 Diesel."
- **Customer Reality:** "I need a safe car for my family that fits a golden retriever and doesn't cost too much to drive."

## 💡 The Solution: Lifestyle Filtering

This prototype explores a **"Human-First" search interface**. instead of forcing the user to filter by technical specs immediately, we guide them through lifestyle choices.

### Key Features in Concept:

- **Visual Lifestyle Cards:** High-level categories like "Family First", "Commuter", or "First Car".
- **Smart Mapping:** Behind the scenes, these cards map to technical filters (e.g., _Family First_ -> `Body: Wagon/SUV`, `Isofix: true`, `Safety Rating: 5`).
- **Frictionless UI:** Big touch targets, clear value propositions, and reduced cognitive load.

## ⚡ Methodology: Rapid AI Prototyping

As a Growth Product Owner, I believe in **validating ideas before committing to expensive production code**.

This entire prototype was ideated and built in **< 2 hours** using modern AI tools.

- **Goal:** Visualize the "North Star" vision for the stakeholder.
- **Process:** Prompt engineering -> Code generation -> Human refinement.
- **Outcome:** A testable artifact to spark discussion about UX direction.
